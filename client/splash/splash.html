      <h6>Both of Christmas' accused assailants were booked into Orleans Parish Prison last week, days before his family buried him Saturday (Sept. 27) in his hometown of Maringouin, west of Baton Rouge.

Christmas' first unlucky encounter this year came while he was at Harrah's on Feb. 21. On his way to the bathroom, he bumped the shoulder of a man. Police say that man and his friend followed Christmas into the bathroom. The two struck him in the head with a glass beer bottle and robbed him of $600 cash and his cell phone, police said in an arrest warrant.

Christmas was hospitalized with minor injuries.</h6>
